# Ente CLI Rust Conversion Plan

## Current Status
The Rust CLI has achieved **feature parity with the Go CLI for photos app** core functionality! Export, sync, and incremental updates are fully working with proper file decryption, metadata handling, progress indicators, and deduplication.

### ‚úÖ Photos App Core Features - COMPLETE

- **Account**: Multi-account support with SRP authentication
- **Storage**: SQLite with efficient schema and indexing
- **Crypto**: All encryption/decryption working (Argon2, XChaCha20-Poly1305, XSalsa20-Poly1305)

### üìù Photos App Remaining Features
- Export filters (by album, date range, shared/hidden)
